k## Computer 
- process information, and yield meaningful results.
- Architecture :The view of a computer presented to software designers.
- Organisation : The actual implementation of a computer in hardware.
- computer type
    - desktop computer
	 - other : watch , calculate,

## Desktop computer 
- **main components (3):**
	- cpu / processor / computer
	- main memory / ram
	- hard disk / rom 
- **peripheral components** 
	 - mouse , keyboard : for input
	 - moniter , printer : for output

## Instruction 
- An instruction is defined as a basic command that can be given to a computer.
- **instruction set**
	- The number of basic instructions/rudimentary commands that a processor can support have to be finite. This set of instructions is typically called the instruction set.
	- Some examples of basic instructions are: add, subtract, multiply, logical or, and logical not. 
	- each instruction needs to work on a set of variables and constants,and finally save the result in a variable.
	- driven by ISA (instruction set architecture)
- **ISA**
	- The semantics of all the instructions supported by a processor is known as the instruction set architecture (ISA). 
	- This includes the semantics of the instructions themselves, along with their operands, and interfaces with peripheral devices.
